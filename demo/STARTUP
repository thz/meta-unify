* start from `bitbake core-image-unify` which results in image
  usually called something like:
         core-image-unify-sun7i-a20-lamobo-r1-20160720104954.rootfs.sunxi-sdimg
* dd that to a sdcard and boot the banana-pi

* bootup
* parted resizepartition 2 ; -1 ... // resize 2nd partition to size of device
* resize2fs /dev/mm*p2

* copy ./config.xml -> /etc/uno-name-resolver/config
* /opt/virtualizer/config/universal-node1-example.xml -> adapt SAPs

* systemctl disable autoisis
* systemctl disable demo-config
* systemctl disable zebra

* systemctl enable unify-virtualizer
* systemctl enable uno-name-resolver
* systemctl enable uno
